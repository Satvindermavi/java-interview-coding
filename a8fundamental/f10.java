/*
note 1: It is wrong to say that if we want to represent the small
 decimal values then we use float as a datatype ,and if we want to 
use larger decimal values then use doouble as the data type.

Infact ,

if we want upto six decimal places acuracy , then go for the float 

and if you want accuracy more than 6 decimal places then 

go with double.

note 1: accuracy here refers to the precision
